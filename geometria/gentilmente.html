Dear Antonio,<br><br>

Thank you for your email. You are most welcome to use my notes! In fact, if you have any feedback or corrections as you use them, I would appreciate hearing from you, since I may want to make a book out of these at some point.
         <br>
Best,<br>

Dear Prof. Fukshansky,
         <br>
I am postdoctoral research associate at University of Campinas, in Brazil, currently pursuing research on Euclidean lattices and applications.
        <br><br>
Next semester, I will be teaching an introductory graduate course on Geometry of Numbers. While doing a google search, I found your very well written <a href="http://www.claremontmckenna.edu/pages/faculty/lenny/papers/m662_notes.pdf">notes</a> on this topic. Although I like the classic bibliography (i.e., Cassels and Lekkerkerker's books), I found your exposition more modern and concise.
         <br><br>
I would like to know if I can use some of the material there as supplementary bibliography to the course. I would provide the link to your webpage for the students, with proper credits. While the notes are freely available on the internet, I felt that I should ask for your authorization before using them.
         <br><br>
Thank you very much for your attention,
         <br>
